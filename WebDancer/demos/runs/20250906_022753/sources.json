At ProductEngineer.camp, you won't just learn how to code—you'll master the art of building and shipping entire digital products from end to end, backed by the modern Ruby on Rails 8 stack. Our program combines immersive technical training with design thinking, UI/UX fundamentals, and product management essentials, so you can confidently deliver delightful, end-to-end solutions that command salaries of $100k+.\nDon't Just Be a Coder, Be a Builder\nPicture this: engineers who don't just speak in code but in product design and customer problems.\nThey're driven by a professional pride and desire to build great products, transcending the traditional developer role to become genuine drivers who go on to put their names behind great products they themselves played a key role in shaping.\nProduct Engineers embody a holistic approach to engineering, where understanding the entire product and context around it is just as important as the technical skills required to build it. This broad perspective enables them to bridge gaps between different technical domains and ensure that the product serves its customers effectively.\nAI: The New Playground\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in software development is rapidly setting new expectations for engineers. With AI tools becoming more sophisticated and capable, engineers are now expected to leverage these tools to enhance their work, not just in terms of speed and efficiency but also in terms of broadening their area of responsibilities.\nEngineers in a post- ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot world are now expected to be able to work in more languages, incorporate more tools and libraries, and simply be able to deliver more, using a broader range of technologies and disciplines in their daily work.\nIt's probably not a great time to be the platform engineer whose job is to set up Jenkins pipelines for the product teams, when ChatGPT can easily help teams do it themselves.\nFor Product Engineers however this has unlocked a higher level of abstraction. With AI tools handling more of the routine and specialised tasks, engineers can allocate more time to creative problem-solving, ideation, and exploring new ways to meet customer needs.\nThis new level of abstraction allows Product Engineers to concentrate on product strategy, user experience, and overall system architecture without being bogged down by the intricacies of individual technologies.\nThe incorporation of AI into software development encourages a broader perspective, where the choice of technology becomes a means to an end, rather than an end in itself.\nWhile AI didn't create the Product Engineer role (examples have been around for much longer); AI has made becoming a true Product E",

    "content": "When I started the [[AI Makerspace](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ai-maker-space?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text)] AI Engineering Bootcamp, I barely had hands-on AI experience. Ten weeks later, I walked out not just with knowledge of advanced RAG pipelines, retrieval strategies, and evaluation frameworks—but with something far more valuable: confidence.\nConfidence that I can take an idea, build it, deploy it, and keep improving it. Confidence that I can own the entire lifecycle of an AI application. That’s life-changing.\nBut here’s the real story ⬇️\nOur cohort was the largest ever—70 people. Out of 60 semifinalists, only 18 advanced to the final demo day. I finished 19th. Just one spot away.\nWas I disappointed? Of course. But I didn’t stop preparing. I worked on my slides, rehearsed my pitch, and told myself: act as if you’re going to present anyway.\nThen—4 hours before demo day—I got the call: “Someone dropped out. You’re next. Want to present?”\nBecause I never stopped preparing, I said yes without hesitation. And I presented Verityn AI, the co-pilot for auditors — replacing weeks of manual document grind with instant, reliable compliance intelligence.\nThat moment hit me hard:\n⚡️ The line between “luck” and “hard work” is razor thin.\n⚡️ Luck favors those who stay ready.\n⚡️ Perseverance creates opportunity.\nI’m deeply grateful to the instructors [👨🏫🤖 \"Dr. Greg\" Loughnane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregloughnane?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) and [Chris \"The Wiz 🪄\" Alexiuk](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/csalexiuk?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text), judges, peer supporters and peers who pushed me and supported me. The certification is proof of the work—but the mindset shift is the real reward.\n👉 If you’re hesitating to start something new—AI, tech, or any passion—don’t wait for perfect timing. Begin. Stay ready. And when the door cracks open, you’ll be ready to walk through it.\nThis is just the onramp. The real journey of building, shipping, and sharing with the AI community is only beginning.\n💬 If you’re curious about the bootcamp, exploring AI, or just thinking about starting fresh in a new field, I’d be glad to share my experience.\n[#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fai&trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) [#Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fengineering&trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) [#Bootcamp](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fbootcamp&trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) [#Perseverance](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fperseverance&trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) [#Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedi",
