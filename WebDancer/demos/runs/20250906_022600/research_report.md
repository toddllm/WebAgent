Generated: 2025-09-06 02:26:23

## Summary

In 2024, several groundbreaking advancements in quantum computing were reported, each addressing fundamental challenges such as entanglement, coherence, and scalability. These developments collectively bring quantum computers closer to practical applications. Key milestones include:

- **Entanglement Milestones**: Researchers entangled 24 logical qubits, setting a world record and demonstrating error correction as qubit counts increase.
- **Strong Long-Distance Qubit Coupling**: At TU Delft, scientists achieved 178 MHz coupling between distant superconducting spin qubits, enabling faster and more efficient quantum gate operations.
- **High-Fidelity Gates**: A team from RIKEN and Toshiba developed a double-transmon coupler achieving 99.92% fidelity for a two-qubit CZ gate and 99.98% for a single-qubit gate, advancing NISQ and error correction capabilities.

These achievements collectively address coherence, entanglement, and control fidelity—three major hurdles in building scalable quantum computers.
