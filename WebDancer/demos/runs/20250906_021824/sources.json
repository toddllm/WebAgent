    "content": "Your original is correct as-is, except you need to remove the question mark at the end because it's not a question.\nWhat I imagine you are already thinking:\nThe sentence ends with a string of \"wh-\" noun clauses. These clauses are not questions, so the last one should also not be a question. \"Which one is the best\" is obviously a question format, so it makes sense that \"which one the best is\" should be the correct form.\nThis is very good instinct, and you could even argue that the grammar is good, but at best it's unnatural.\nWhen we replace the superlative \"the best\" with the normal version, we get this:\n*I am going to cover which one good is.\nI hope we can both agree this sentence is wrong because \"good\" is an adjective, and cannot be the subject of \"is\". The same is true when you put \"the best\" in that spot. It's easy to argue that \"the best\" could be correct as the subject since superlatives are often used as nouns (as in \"The best is this one\" where \"the best\" stands for \"the best one\"), but when reworded into a noun clause, superlatives only feel like adjectives, so \"which one the best is\" doesn't work.\nNow, you might be thinking that \"which one is the best\" cannot be correct since it's a question format. The answer is that like many other similar phrases, the question format and the noun clause format look the same:\nWhich hammers are on sale? (question format)\nI'm hoping you can tell me which hammers are on sale. (non-question format)\n*I'm hoping you can tell me which hammers on sale are. (bad grammar)\nFor a more thorough explanation of why the two formats look the same, see JavaLatte's answer and note that \"the best\" is a complement.",

What was the best choice for this purpose?\nPlastic, wood, or metal container? What was best to choose for this purpose?\nEither is acceptable, and the practical meaning is the same, but their referents, implicit not explicit, are different.\nIn many sentences it will not matter if \"best\" or \"the best\" is used. To my ear, \"best\" on its own tends to sound better, but that may be due to the way my family spoke as I was growing up. However, sometimes grammar demands one or the other.\nWhat was the best present you received?\nThis just doesn't work without the \"the\".\nIt will be best if we just forget about it.\nOpposite of the first example. Adding \"the\" doesn't work, although one could substitute the prepositional phrase, \"for the best\". The phrase requires \"the\".\nThe confusion arises because the word best can be used as any of several different parts of speech.\nOn the linked page, best is used as an adverb, modifying the verb knew. In that context, the phrase the best can also be used as if it were an adverb. The meaning is approximately the same in that case.\nIn the following sentence, however, best is an adjective: \"What was best?\"\nIf we insert the word the, we get a noun phrase, the best. You could certainly declare that after comparing a number of things, you found that a particular one of those things was the best. That is to say, it was better than any of the others. So if you knew someone who had tried going up, going down, going left, and going right, you could ask them for their evaluation of the relative benefits of each of those actions: \"Which was the best?\" (Note that I would say which rather than what.)\nAssuming that the passage in the question is about the thinking of someone who is faced with choosing a course of action to take, not evaluating the outcome of an action already taken, I would use best as an adjective.\nWhat was best?
