# Research Report: best coding agents based on LLMs

Generated: 2025-09-06 02:01:11

## Summary
The original research question—"best coding agents based on LLMs"—requires clarification regarding what constitutes "best." The term "best" can vary depending on context and usage—whether it refers to quality, performance, user experience, or another metric. Additionally, the question must be narrowed down to identify specific coding agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Codex, Qwen, etc.) and compare them using a defined set of criteria.

To proceed, we need to evaluate how coding agents perform in tasks such as code completion, debugging, documentation generation, and integration with IDEs. We'll then assess which ones are based on LLMs (Large Language Models), and determine which is currently considered the best among them.

## Key Findings

### Source 1: "best" vs. "the best" vs. "most" in comparative contexts
- **Best** (without "the") is used when referring to a top choice from unspecified options: *"I like chocolate best"*.
- **The best** is used when a specific item is chosen from a set: *"I like vanilla the best out of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry."*
- **Most** is generally used with comparative adjectives or adverbs: *"I like you most"* or *"I love you most"*, not *"I love you the best"*. This usage is considered incorrect in standard English.

### Source 2: "it is best" vs. "it is the best"
- **"It is best not to do something"** – uses "best" as an adverb modifying the verb "to do".
- **"It is the best car in the garage"** – uses "the best" as an adjective modifying "car", making it definite.

### Source 3: "Which one is the best" vs. "which one the best is"
- Both forms are structurally similar but differ in nuance and acceptability.
- *"Which one is the best"* is grammatically correct but sounds less natural.
- *"Which one the best is"* is grammatically invalid because "the best" cannot serve as a subject.

### Source 4: "What was best" vs. "What was the best"
- Both forms are acceptable but imply slightly different referents.
- *"What was best"* suggests a general evaluation of qualities.
- *"What was the best"* implies a specific, definite choice.
- Context determines which form is appropriate.

### Source 5: "At best" as an adverbial phrase
- **At best** functions as an adverbial phrase, modifying adjectives or clauses.
- Examples: *"Their response was, at best, cool."* – modifies “cool”.

### Coding Agents Based on LLMs

Several popular coding assistants are built on LLMs:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Uses GPT-like models.
- **Google Bard (Codex)**: Based on large language models.
- **Qwen**: Part of the Qwen suite by Alibaba Cloud, powered by LLaMA.
- **Claude**: Developed by Anthropic, also uses LLMs.
- **Replit AI**: Integrates multiple LLMs like Qwen and Claude.

Each has unique strengths and weaknesses depending on use case.

### Comparative Analysis

| Agent | LLM Used | Key Features | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| GitHub Copilot | GPT-3.5 & 4 | Code completion, IDE integration, natural language understanding | Fast, integrates well with IDEs, supports multi-language | Limited explainability, occasionally generates bugs |
| Codex (Bard) | Google’s LLM | Code generation, documentation, refactoring | Strong performance in generating functional code | Less IDE integration compared to Copilot |
| Qwen | Alibaba’s LLaMA | Code generation, documentation, natural language assistance | High performance, explainable AI | Lower availability, still in beta |
| Claude | Anthropic’s LLM | Code completion, debugging, documentation | Strong reasoning capabilities, human-like responses | Performance varies across languages |
| Replit AI | Qwen + Claude | Full-stack development environment, auto-completion | Scalable, supports deployment | Limited open-source access |

### Current Best Coding Agent Based on LLMs

Based on current performance, **GitHub Copilot** remains the most widely adopted and effective coding assistant integrated with major IDEs (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.). It excels in fast code completion and natural language understanding, making it highly accessible. While **Codex (Bard)** shows strong potential in code generation, **Qwen** from Alibaba Cloud is rapidly improving and may surpass Codex in the near future due to its explainable AI features and LLaMA foundation.

## Conclusion

The term "best" depends heavily on context
