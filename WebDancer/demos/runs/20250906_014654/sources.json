    "content": "Computer Science > Information Retrieval\n[Submitted on 7 Aug 2025 (\n[v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05748v1)), last revised 1 Sep 2025 (this version, v3)]Title:WebWatcher: Breaking New Frontier of Vision-Language Deep Research Agent\n[View PDF](/pdf/2508.05748)\nAbstract:Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems. However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning. To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex information retrieval involving both visual and textual information. Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal information-seeking tasks.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Xinyu Geng [[view email](/show-email/3ec4256f/2508.05748)]\n[[v1]](/abs/2508.05748v1)Thu, 7 Aug 2025 18:03:50 UTC (2,822 KB)\n[[v2]](/abs/2508.05748v2)Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:09:49 UTC (2,491 KB)\n[v3] Mon, 1 Sep 2025 03:21:53 UTC (2,485 KB)\nReferences & Citations\nexport BibTeX citation\nLoading...\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (\n[What is the Explorer?](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographic-explorer))\nConnected Papers (\n[What is Connected Papers?](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about))\nLitmaps (\n[What is Litmaps?](https://www.litmaps.co/))\nscite Smart Citations (\n[What are Smart Citations?](https://www.scite.ai/))Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (\n[What is alphaXiv?](https://alphaxiv.org/))\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (\n[What is CatalyzeX?](https://www.catalyzex.com))\nDagsHub (\n[What is DagsHub?](https://dagshub.com/))\nGotit.pub (\n[What is GotitPub?](http://gotit.pub/faq))\nHugging Face (\n[What is Huggingface?](https://huggingface.co/huggingface))\nPapers with Code (\n[What is Papers with Code?](https://paperswithcode.com/))\nScienceCast (\n[What is ScienceCast?](https://sciencecast.org/welcome))Demos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (\n[What are Influence Flowers?](https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/))\nCORE Recommender (\n[What is CORE?](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender))arXivLabs: experimental projects with communit",

    "content": "WebWatcher: Multimodal Research Agent\n- WebWatcher is a multimodal system that integrates visual-language reasoning, advanced tool use (OCR, image search, code execution), and continuous decision cycles to address complex web tasks.\n- It employs an iterative 'think–act–observe' framework, enabling adaptive decision-making through dynamic tool invocation and multimodal input processing.\n- Benchmark evaluations (e.g., BrowseComp-VL) show that WebWatcher outperforms traditional text-centric agents, offering significant advancements in multimodal research applications.\nWebWatcher denotes a multimodal research agent system specifically designed to perform advanced information-seeking tasks requiring both vision and language understanding ([Geng et al., 7 Aug 2025](/papers/2508.05748)). In contrast to earlier agents with text-centric architectures, WebWatcher integrates visual-language reasoning, fine-grained tool use, and continuous decision-making optimized for high-difficulty, real-world information environments.\n1. Motivation and Scope\nWebWatcher addresses the fundamental limitation observed in prior deep research agents: lack of robust visual reasoning and insufficient tool integration for real-world multimodal tasks. Previous web agents excelled primarily in tasks associated with textual content, resulting in limited efficacy when tasked to operate in environments dense with images, charts, web GUIs, or other non-textual artifacts. By equipping the agent with modules for image search, [OCR](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/out-of-context-reasoning-ocr) capabilities, web text search, flexible browsing, and even embedded code execution, WebWatcher achieves the necessary depth for advanced multimodal reasoning. This design enables the agent to tackle information-seeking tasks spanning both textual and visual modalities, such as extracting insights from diagrams or reconciling text and image content within complex web interfaces.\n2. System Architecture and Tool Integration\nWebWatcher is architected around an iterative \"think–act–observe\" decision cycle. The operational workflow incorporates:\n- Input Module: Accepts both textual queries and images, supporting a broad range of multimodal prompts.\n- Action Planner: Functions as a multimodal decision engine, synthesizing the current context and selecting among discrete tool actions (e.g., selecting between image search, visit webpage, run OCR, or invoke\n[code interpreter](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/code-interpreter-ci)). - Tool Integration Layer: Manages invocation and argument passing for external modules, including:\n- Web Image Search\n- Web Text Search\n- Interactive Webpage Visit\n- In-house OCR module\n- Code interpreter for\n[dynamic reasoning](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/dynamic-reasoning)steps\nThe agent generates and executes tool-use trajectories, formulated as: where denotes the -th tool invocation and its observation. This framework facilitates non-templated, context-driven expl",

Learn how it uses vision-language reasoning and a sophisticated toolset to perform deep research, outperforming models like GPT-4 on complex, real-world information-seeking tasks.\nWe stand at a remarkable moment in technological history. AI assistants, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are weaving themselves into the fabric of our digital lives. They write code, draft emails, and summarize dense documents with astonishing fluency. We’ve given them access to the world’s text, and in return, they’ve given us superhuman abilities in processing it.\nBut for all their power, these brilliant minds have a profound, almost tragic, disability: they are blind.\nThey operate in a world devoid of images, charts, diagrams, and the rich visual context that makes up over 80% of the information on the internet. Ask an AI to analyze a sales report, and it will read the text. But ask it to interpret the accompanying sales trend chart, and it hits a wall. This is the Achilles’ heel of modern AI research — a deep, cognitive gap between its linguistic prowess and its perceptual understanding of the world.\nThis isn’t just about recognizing cats in photos. It’s about the fundamental nature of knowledge. A scientific paper is a blend of text and diagrams. A financial analysis combines numbers…",
