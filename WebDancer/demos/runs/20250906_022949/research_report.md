Generated: 2025-09-06 02:30:13

## Summary

This report evaluates the best coding agents based on LLMs (Large Language Models) in 2025, focusing on three prominent tools—Cursor, Windsurf, and Bolt—based on their features, developer feedback, and capabilities. The analysis highlights Cursor as the top choice due to its deep contextual understanding, real-time collaboration, and agentic thinking, making it ideal for complex, large-scale projects. Windsurf is noted for its intuitive agent mode and effectiveness in managing extensive codebases, while Bolt is promising but lacks detailed coverage in the sources.

## Key Findings

### Source 1: "Which AI Agent is Best for Coding in 2025?"

- **Cursor** is identified as the best overall AI coding agent, excelling in handling large and complex projects. It offers deep contextual understanding, real-time collaboration, and multi-file smart editing. One developer noted: *"Cursor excels when your project gets big and complex."*
- **Windsurf**, another top contender, is praised for its intuitive agent mode and robustness for large codebases.
- **Bolt** is mentioned but not extensively compared; it's described as a favorite among developers but lacks detailed comparison data.

### Source 2: "License to Kill: Coding with Cursor AI Agents"

- Cursor is described as a "RAG application" (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), allowing agents to act semi-autonomously within a developer’s control.
- Features include **inline completions**, **tab to complete**, **chat with code**, **fix in chat**, and **agentic thinking**, making it highly flexible for advanced users.
- Cursor integrates smoothly with VS Code, retains user settings, and supports agentic actions like file creation and deletion.

### Source 3: "Cursor - The AI Code Editor"

- Cursor is positioned as a productivity-enhancing AI-powered code editor built on VS Code, offering advanced AI functionalities without disrupting existing workflows.

### Source 4: "Fine - Build Software with AI Agents"

- Highlights various AI agent platforms including Bolt, but the content is fragmented and lacks structured comparison details.

### Developer Sentiment

- Cursor is frequently praised for handling large, complex projects and enabling agentic thinking, which is critical for advanced development.
- Windsurf is seen as intuitive and effective for navigating large codebases.
- Bolt is mentioned positively but lacks comparative depth.

## Contradictions/Uncertainties

There is no clear contradiction between sources regarding Cursor's dominance in handling large and complex projects. However, Windsurf is consistently highlighted as a strong competitor, which could imply a slight edge in handling extensive codebases. Bolt's status remains unclear due to limited coverage in the sources.
