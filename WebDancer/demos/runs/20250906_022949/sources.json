    "content": "Which AI Agent is Best for Coding in 2025?\nIn the fast-paced world of software development, AI agents have become indispensable tools for coders, streamlining workflows, enhancing productivity, and even tackling complex tasks. With so many options available, choosing the right AI agent for coding can be overwhelming. In this article, we’ll explore the top AI agents for coding in 2025, based on their features, capabilities, and real-world performance.\nWe’ve also tapped into developer sentiment from X and other sources to give you a sense of current trends. Whether you’re a seasoned programmer or just starting out, this guide will help you find the best AI agent to supercharge your coding journey.\nWhy AI Agents Are Revolutionizing Coding\nAI agents are transforming the way developers work by automating repetitive tasks, providing real-time suggestions, and even generating entire code snippets. These tools leverage advanced machine learning models, such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to understand codebases, predict needs, and offer context-aware assistance. The result? Faster development cycles, fewer bugs, and more time for creative problem-solving. But with so many AI agents on the market, it’s crucial to choose one that aligns with your specific needs — whether that’s multi-language support, seamless IDE integration, or advanced debugging capabilities.\nTop AI Agents for Coding in 2025\nHere’s a rundown of the leading AI agents making waves in the coding community this year.\n1. Cursor\n[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) is widely regarded as the best overall AI coding agent, especially for advanced users working on large and complex projects. Its deep contextual understanding and real-time collaboration features make it a standout choice. Cursor excels at handling intricate codebases, offering multi-file smart editing and seamless integration with development environments. However, it comes with a steeper learning curve, which might be challenging for beginners. Developers on X have praised Cursor for its ability to manage big projects efficiently, with one user noting it “excels when your project gets big and complex.”\n- Key Features: Deep contextual understanding, real-time collaboration, multi-file editing.\n- Best For: Advanced developers working on large, complex projects.\n2. Windsurf\n[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) targets the same advanced user base as Cursor but is often highlighted for its strong and intuitive agent mode. It’s particularly effective for handling large codebases, with some developers claiming it outperforms Cursor in this area. Windsurf’s agent mode allows for seamless interaction, making it easier to navigate and modify extensive projects. Its intuitive design and powerful features make it a top contender for experienced coders.\n- Key Features: Intuitive agent mode, excellent for large codebases.\n- Best For: Advanced developers who need robust tools for extensive projects.\n3. Bolt\n[Bolt](https://bolt.new/) is a favorite among",

Cursor is also agentic, meaning it can act semi-autonomously like an agent under your control to complete tasks that you two agree on in advance.

    "content": "License to Kill: Coding with Cursor AI Agents\nCursor, an AI code writing and editing tool, represents a significant advance in the practical use of artificial intelligence in software development, primarily by offering “agents” that can not only answer questions but act on their own ideas. This powerful new ability requires a new approach to programming where your advanced reasoning skills become even more important than before. When an agent is “licensed to kill,” your instructions as Director make all the difference.\nThis article is part of my AI Library. The articles are listed in order of complexity. They’re not meant as prerequisites but rather alternative entry points to these topics:\nYour Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It\nI want to show you how to find Cursor’s most clever features and how to use them to maximum advantage, but I don’t recommend that you start there. If you’ve worked with other AI tools, dive in at the point where you’re using Cursor the same way as you used your last tool. For me, that was VS Code with Copilot. Once any “differences” in Cursor are smoothed out, try the next level of sophistication.\nHere’s what we’ll cover. Feel free to skip any parts you already know about or have tried.\n- What Is Cursor & Why?\n- Inline Completions\n- Tab to Complete\n- Chat with Code\n- Fix in Chat\n- Agentic Thinking\n- Copying Your Style\n- Settings\n- Token Limits\n- Running an Agent\nLate Update: Cursor has changed the user interface to combine the Chat and Composer tabs into one chat box, so your screenshots may vary from mine.\n1. Wherefore Art Thou, Cursor?\nWhat Is Cursor & Why\n[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) is one of the first truly useful RAG applications. Retrieval Augmented Generation is a fancy way of saying “use AI chat to figure out how to control the interface of an application instead of just pressing buttons and clicking menus.” Every RAG application combines some traditional user interface with a backing LLM or [Large Language Model](https://medium.com/gitconnected/something-from-nothing-d755f49d6636) and a chat box. For Cursor, the traditional application is VS Code, an IDE or text editor optimized for writing code.\nCursor is also agentic, meaning it can act semi-autonomously like an agent under your control to complete tasks that you two agree on in advance. That control can extend from creating new files and fixing hundreds of lines at once across multiple modules — to deleting files, breaking interfaces, and preventing your code from running. Hence the title of this article.\nIf you’re already used to VS Code, you can import your key bindings and settings. I had to make one small adjustment because one of my custom keys was taken over by Cursor, but it was easy to fix because my binding wasn’t wiped out. Removing the Cursor binding left my original there and working. This import feature makes it easy to move to Cursor from VS Code, which is the most popular IDE by a wide margin.\nYou may be asking at this point, “If Cur",
